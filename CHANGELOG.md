# Changelog

All notable changes to OmniProject are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from 1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Hardened the deploy stack** (`docker-compose.standalone.yml`,
  `docker-compose.enterprise.yml`, `k8s-enterprise-manifest.yaml`). Pinned every
  image to a verified tag (no `:latest`); fail-fast required secrets (`${VAR:?}`,
  no more `changeme` defaults); healthchecks on every service with health-gated
  startup ordering; dropped the deprecated `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_*` (n8n uses
  owner-account setup now). The standalone stack now serves **real TLS for
  `*.local`** via mkcert + a Traefik file provider (ACME can't issue for `.local`),
  with the OIDC issuer on `https://authentik.local` resolved through Traefik
  network aliases (no host hairpin), and the Traefik dashboard moved behind
  basicauth instead of the open `:8080`. New bootstrap guide:
  [docs/DEPLOY-LOCAL.md](docs/DEPLOY-LOCAL.md).

### Fixed
- **Deploy files set the removed `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`** — renamed to `BROKER_URL`
  across all three deploy artifacts. As written they silently ignored the broker
  endpoint and ran in demo mode after 0.2.0. Upgraders: rename the var in your
  deployment env/config.
- **`.env` could leak into the image** — `.dockerignore` now excludes
  `.env`/`*.pem`/`*.key`/`certs` (the Dockerfile does `COPY . .`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-24

**Decoupling from n8n.** Early feedback on the 0.1.0 launch kept landing on one
worry: *"isn't this just an n8n front-end — what happens to my data if n8n goes
away?"* This release answers it structurally. n8n is still the only broker that
ships, and the wire contract is byte-for-byte unchanged — but the codebase is now
*incapable of knowing the broker is n8n* above a single seam. If n8n is ever
superseded, you implement one class and nothing else moves. The public surface is
renamed to match (no more n8n in the API, env, or settings you touch).

### Removed (BREAKING)
- **The n8n-named public surface is gone — use the canonical broker names.**
  Pre-1.0 cleanup: `POST /api/n8n-proxy` → `POST /api/broker/command`;
  `Settings.n8nWebhookUrl` → `brokerUrl`; `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` env → `BROKER_URL`;
  and `GET /api/setup/status.n8n` → `.broker` (`{ configured, urlSet }`). If you
  ran 0.1.0, update your `.env` (rename `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` to `BROKER_URL`), any
  external API clients, and saved config snapshots accordingly.

### Changed
- **Broker boundary extraction.** The gateway now talks to a single `Broker`
  interface in its own domain vocabulary instead of calling n8n directly. n8n is
  the first/only implementation (`N8nBroker`); demo mode is a second
  (`DemoBroker`) rather than a parallel code path. All n8n specifics are confined
  to one adapter, and an architecture-guard test fails CI if any n8n-ism leaks
  above the seam — so the data path is structurally incapable of knowing the
  broker is n8n. Behaviour-preserving: same API surface, same n8n wire contract,
  same demo experience. See [docs/BROKER.md](docs/BROKER.md) and
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-broker-boundary.md).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

First public release. A stateless program-management overlay over headless PM
backends, with n8n as the exclusive data broker.

### Added

- **Overlay core** — stateless gateway (Express) + SPA (React 19), federating
  projects/issues/activity from any backend n8n can reach. Persists no project
  data; reads and writes are brokered through a single n8n webhook.
- **Programmes** — optional grouping of projects with programme-wide rollup and
  drill-down.
- **Identity & RBAC** — OIDC relying party (Auth Code + PKCE) with ID-token JWKS
  verification; viewer/contributor/manager/admin roles mapped from IdP claims;
  read-only API tokens for BI clients; demo mode when no IdP is set.
- **Enterprise backends** — declarative manifests + an n8n workflow generator
  for Jira, OpenProject, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow, Asana,
  Monday, Trello, Wrike, ClickUp, and the large ERPs (SAP, Primavera, Dynamics
  365, MS Project).
- **Reporting & exports** — portfolio health (RAG/variance), EVM, resource and
  progress views; CSV/XLSX/PDF/Markdown/JSON exports; OData v4 read service and a
  Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for SAP/Power BI/Grafana.
- **Real-time** — SSE notifications with a pluggable in-process/Redis fan-out bus.
- **Internationalisation** — en/fr/de/es with multi-currency formatting.
- **Operations** — configurable action audit (off/writes/all, optional NDJSON
  sink), config snapshots, named environments with versioned rollback, and a
  stateful developer mode (non-production only) with a debug bundle.
- **Premium overlay (licensed)** — white-label branding, company-nomenclature
  label overrides, outbound webhooks, and enterprise workflow generation, gated
  by a time-limited Ed25519-signed licence key (`402` when unlicensed).
- **Monetisation** — Stripe and Gumroad webhooks that verify the purchase, mint a
  signed licence, and hand it to an n8n fulfilment workflow that emails the buyer
  their key. Importable fulfilment blueprint included.

### Security

- Trust-boundary documentation, identity-spoofing protection on the n8n proxy,
  optimistic concurrency, idempotency + loop-guard, rate limiting, and pino
  secret redaction. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
