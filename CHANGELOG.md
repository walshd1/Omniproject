# Changelog

All notable changes to OmniProject are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from 1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Broker boundary extraction.** The gateway now talks to a single `Broker`
  interface in its own domain vocabulary instead of calling n8n directly. n8n is
  the first/only implementation (`N8nBroker`); demo mode is a second
  (`DemoBroker`) rather than a parallel code path. All n8n specifics are confined
  to one adapter, and an architecture-guard test fails CI if any n8n-ism leaks
  above the seam — so the data path is structurally incapable of knowing the
  broker is n8n. Behaviour-preserving: same API surface, same n8n wire contract,
  same demo experience. See [docs/BROKER.md](docs/BROKER.md) and
  [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-broker-boundary.md).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

First public release. A stateless program-management overlay over headless PM
backends, with n8n as the exclusive data broker.

### Added

- **Overlay core** — stateless gateway (Express) + SPA (React 19), federating
  projects/issues/activity from any backend n8n can reach. Persists no project
  data; reads and writes are brokered through a single n8n webhook.
- **Programmes** — optional grouping of projects with programme-wide rollup and
  drill-down.
- **Identity & RBAC** — OIDC relying party (Auth Code + PKCE) with ID-token JWKS
  verification; viewer/contributor/manager/admin roles mapped from IdP claims;
  read-only API tokens for BI clients; demo mode when no IdP is set.
- **Enterprise backends** — declarative manifests + an n8n workflow generator
  for Jira, OpenProject, GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow, Asana,
  Monday, Trello, Wrike, ClickUp, and the large ERPs (SAP, Primavera, Dynamics
  365, MS Project).
- **Reporting & exports** — portfolio health (RAG/variance), EVM, resource and
  progress views; CSV/XLSX/PDF/Markdown/JSON exports; OData v4 read service and a
  Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint for SAP/Power BI/Grafana.
- **Real-time** — SSE notifications with a pluggable in-process/Redis fan-out bus.
- **Internationalisation** — en/fr/de/es with multi-currency formatting.
- **Operations** — configurable action audit (off/writes/all, optional NDJSON
  sink), config snapshots, named environments with versioned rollback, and a
  stateful developer mode (non-production only) with a debug bundle.
- **Premium overlay (licensed)** — white-label branding, company-nomenclature
  label overrides, outbound webhooks, and enterprise workflow generation, gated
  by a time-limited Ed25519-signed licence key (`402` when unlicensed).
- **Monetisation** — Stripe and Gumroad webhooks that verify the purchase, mint a
  signed licence, and hand it to an n8n fulfilment workflow that emails the buyer
  their key. Importable fulfilment blueprint included.

### Security

- Trust-boundary documentation, identity-spoofing protection on the n8n proxy,
  optimistic concurrency, idempotency + loop-guard, rate limiting, and pino
  secret redaction. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Licensing

- Core licensed under **Apache-2.0**; premium components under the
  **OmniProject Premium License**. Provided **as is, without warranty**. See
  [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
